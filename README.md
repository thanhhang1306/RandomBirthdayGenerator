# RandomBirthdayGenerator
Java code for a random birthday generator, accounting for leap years. The generator takes dates from January 1st, 2000 to December 31st, 2003 to account for the probability of each date occuring. This means that February 29th has a much lower probability of occuring compared to all other dates.
